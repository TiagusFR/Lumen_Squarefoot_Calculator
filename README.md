Description: On this project I wanted to simplify the lumens per squarefoot. The calculation itself is simple but with different measurement units it can take a while. 
So, my goal is not to make the user busy converting 'watts' to 'lumens' or 'square meter' to 'square feet'. 

Files: 
cal.py was the primary version where I just tested the main calculation 

calc.py is the main version where it does the whole conversions and results

Without an interface yet, outputs goes like:
